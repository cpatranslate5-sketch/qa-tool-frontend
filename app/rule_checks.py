# a mismatch (this is exactly the false positive he hit: "50000"/"50.000"
# flagged as different numbers). Same exactly-3-digit-group shape as the
# comma version, so it carries the same accepted ambiguity — a genuine
# 3-decimal-place fraction like "0.125" would also match this shape and get

        dropping, or switching which punctuation mark groups the number

        a translation that correctly kept some of a promo's numbers

        the source is usually English (period), while many of the agency's

    stays one atom. What's left with 2+ separators is a DATE written as one
    glued-together run — "22.09.2026" — since an ordinary decimal or a
    recognized thousands grouping never reaches this branch (a dotted
    thousands number like "50.000" is already resolved to one atom by
    _normalize_number before this function's date-vs-grouping decision
    even runs, precisely so it's never mistaken for a 2-part date

    the grouping itself is expected to change between languages:
    day/month/year can come in a different order, and the separator can be
    "." or "/" (a slash-separated date like "09/22/2026" never even
    reaches here as one token, since '/' isn't part of NUMBER_RE — it's
    already three separate atoms). So a dotted date is split into its
    individual digit groups and compared as a multiset, order and
    separator both ignored — only the actual digits have to survive
    translation, exactly as Александр asked for after "22.09.2026" (from a
