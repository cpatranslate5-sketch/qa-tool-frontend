"""
Parsing for the project's Tone-of-address reference document
(formal/informal register per language) — the only reference document
this app still has.

Language codes run across the header row as columns, with the register
sitting in the row(s) below (see parse_tone_workbook).

Governs an AI check that refuses to run at all for a project with no
rows uploaded (see app.main._require_doc) — but a doc uploaded without a
column for some particular language just means that language's check is
skipped for that language, not blocked.

(Two other documents used to live alongside this one but were removed:
Numerals — number/currency/date format per language — and Glossary —
required term-by-term translations. Both AI checks built on them kept
getting things wrong in ways that weren't worth patching further, so
both features were dropped rather than fixed again.)
